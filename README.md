## Estimate Bilan Alimentaire de la Mauritanie
This project aims to estimate the Bilan Alimentaire (food balance) of Mauritania, specifically focusing on the human food availability and calorific availability. The project utilizes Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications, to provide an intuitive user interface for estimating and visualizing the food and calorific availability.

## Features
The application provides the following features:

- Disponibilite alimentaire humaine (Human Food Availability): This feature allows users to estimate and analyze the overall food availability for human consumption in Mauritania. Users can input relevant data and parameters to calculate the food availability based on different factors such as agricultural production, imports, exports, and stock variations.

- Disponibilite calorifique (Calorific Availability): This feature focuses on estimating the calorific availability of food in Mauritania. By considering the energy content of various food items and their availability, users can calculate the total calorific availability to assess the dietary energy supply of the population.


## Usage :
The datasets are confidential.
